  <h3>hi there, i'm gabi 👋</h3>

  greetings, i'm gabrielle, a 19-year-old girl who's all about the coding life, especially in [clojure](https://clojure.org) and functional programming languages. [type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory) and crafting [compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) are in my jam, and i've got this knack for solving problems – the trickier, the better! collaboration is my secret sauce, and i'm always up for teaming up to crush some goals. i'm a wild thinker, forever on the lookout for cool ways to upgrade existing tech or invent something totally new. firm believer in using tech for good and making a positive impact.
