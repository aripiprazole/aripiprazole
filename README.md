  <h3>Hi there, I'm Gabi 👋</h3>

  Greetings, my name is Gabrielle. I'm a 17-year-old transgender girl on the autism spectrum. My primary language is Kotlin, and I enjoy crafting compilers. I have a talent for problem-solving, and I relish the opportunity to take on intricate challenges and find one-of-a-kind solutions. Collaboration is essential to me, and I am always happy to work with others to achieve shared objectives. I am an innovative thinker and constantly on the lookout for ways to enhance current technologies and invent new ones. I am a firm believer in using technology to create a better world, and I always look for methods to have a constructive impact.
